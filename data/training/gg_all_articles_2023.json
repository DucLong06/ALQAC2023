A plant variety is a population of plants. distinguishable from other plant populations by the expression of at least one trait and passable to the next generation; morphologically uniform, stable over propagation cycles; of cultural value effects, use values; including agricultural plant varieties, medicinal plant varieties, ornamental plant varieties and edible mushroom varieties.\n\n6. Propagation material is a plant or part of a plant, an edible mushroom or a part of an edible mushroom that can develop into a new individual, used for propagation or for sowing.\n\n7. The main plant species is the commonly grown tree species, which is important in economic development, and should be strictly managed.\n\n8. Annual plants are plants that are planted, harvested and finished in a production cycle within a period of no more than 01 year, including annuals that are kept at the root.\n\n9. Perennial crops are plants that are planted once, grown for many years, and harvested one or more times.\n\n10. Varietal distinctiveness is the ability of a plant variety to clearly distinguish a variety from well-known cultivars.\n\n11. The homogeneity of a plant variety is the expression of the same plant variety in terms of related traits, except for deviations within the allowable range for some specific traits during propagation.\n\n12. Plant variety stability is the steady expression of the relevant traits as originally described, which is not altered after each propagation season or after each propagation cycle in the case of cyclic propagation. \n\n13. Plant variety testing is an activity of monitoring and evaluating criteria to determine the distinctiveness, uniformity, stability, cultivation value and use value of plant varieties according to certain methods. n\n14. Controlled trial means testing a plant variety in an artificial environment so that the plant variety can fully demonstrate its resistance to harmful organisms and adverse conditions.\n\n15. Fertilizer trial is an activity of monitoring and evaluating criteria in order to determine the use method, environmental impact, agronomic efficiency and economic efficiency of fertilizer.\n\n16. Narrow field trial is a field trial, with a small plot area, repeated, and arranged according to national standards on testing methods for tested subjects.\n\n17. A large-scale trial is a field trial, with a large plot area, without repetition, and arranged according to national standards on testing methods for tested subjects.\n\n18. A flagship tree is the best tree selected and recognized from the population of a cultivar .\n\n19. First-line orchard is an orchard that is multiplied from a leading tree or an orchard established and recognized by an organization or individual.\n\n20. Fertilizer is a product that has the function of providing nutrients or improving the soil to increase yield and quality for plants.\n\n21. Fertilizer quality criteria are specifications on characteristics, composition, and content reflecting the quality of fertilizers specified in the respective published technical regulations and standards.\n\n22.
